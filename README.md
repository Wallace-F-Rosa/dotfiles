# Dotfiles
All the configuration files/directories that I use on linux. The configurations here were made and tested in Ubuntu 20.04 but you will be able to use most configurations on any Linux that uses ~/.config as configuration folder and bash as shell.

## What are dotfiles?
Dotfiles usually refer to configuration files/directories used in Unix like systems(such as Linux). They are called that way because the file names usually have a "." (dot) at the beggining of the file name.

## How to use this repository
Simply use the install.sh to install the files:
